The application's back-end is available [here](https://github.com/anetaclaudia/vocabulary-backend)

## Prerequisites for running the application
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your device, and it is added to your environment variable.

## Running the application locally
These instructions only include running application's front-end. To see instructions about back-end, go see [back-end's project](https://github.com/anetaclaudia/vocabulary-backend)
1. Download or clone the project.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or run it from the command-line.
3. Open IDE's inner terminal - make sure you are in `vocabulary-frontend` directory. If you're running the project from the command line, same goes here - switch into the project directory.
   - In your project directory, run `npm install` - it should add all the needed node modules.
   - Install Angular CLI `npm install @angular/cli`
   - Run `npm run ng build`
